# wordle-solver
A solver for the popular game Wordle (The NYT version)

### Features:
1. Populates words to DB based on included dictionary file
1. Prints the number of solution possibilities
1. Prints the first 20 possible solutions

### Roadmap:
1. Remove the local dictionary file and move it to the source
1. Automate it further to make it solve on its own (using Selenium)

### What's the point of all this?
Yes, I know that this literally spoils the game. I'm doing this, because, why not? I am not going to spoil it for everybody.
Those who wish to use this may feel free to. And the rest who wish to play it right, can still continue to!
This is just a result of a weekend fun coding session.
